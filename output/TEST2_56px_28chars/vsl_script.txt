SLIDES:

Slide 1:
Purpose: VSL Slide 1
Script: My sister called me in tears. She'd been struggling with brain fog for months - forgetting why she walked into rooms, losing her train of thought mid-sentence. She felt like she was losing her mind at only 42 years old.

Slide 2:
Purpose: VSL Slide 2

Slide 3:
Purpose: VSL Slide 3
