Slide 2:
Purpose: VSL Slide 2

Slide 4:

Slide 5:
Purpose: VSL Slide 5

Purpose: VSL Slide 6
Script: I ordered some and started drinking it daily. Day 3: I woke up feeling refreshed for the first time in years. Day 7: My brain fog lifted and I could focus for hours. Week 2: My wife said I was a new man - energetic, clear-headed, and more present than ever.

Slide 7:
Purpose: VSL Slide 7
